# üìß Spam Filter using Various Classifiers

This project implements a spam filter using multiple machine learning classification algorithms. The goal is to detect and classify emails as spam or not spam based on their textual content. It compares the performance of various classifiers to determine the most effective model.

## üöÄ Features

- Preprocessing of raw email/text data
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Training and evaluation of multiple classifiers:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Performance comparison using metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrix

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- XGBoost
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used is a labeled email dataset containing both spam and ham messages.  
> If you're using the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset), include this note and the download instructions.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakethjaxx/Email-Spam-Classification-Using-XGBoost-and-Random-Forest-Classifiers-.git
   cd Email-Spam-Classification-Using-XGBoost-and-Random-Forest-Classifiers-
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `spam_filter_using_various_classifiers_IMPLEMENTABLE.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.

## üìä Results

A comparison of classifiers shows varying performance. SVM and XGBoost generally outperform others in precision and recall. Full metrics are plotted in the notebook for interpretation.

## ü§î Future Work

- Add deep learning-based models (e.g., LSTM or BERT).
- Use more sophisticated NLP preprocessing (lemmatization, stopword removal).
- Deploy the model as a web service.

## üìÑ License

This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
